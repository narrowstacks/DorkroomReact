# Dorkroom

Dorkroom is a cross-platform React Native application built with Expo, designed to provide photographers with essential calculators for darkroom printing, film developing, and photography workflows. The app features multiple specialized calculators with real-time calculations, preset management, and responsive design across mobile, tablet, and web platforms.

## Features

### Fully Implemented Calculators

- **Print Border Calculator**: Calculate blade positions for adjustable darkroom easels with various paper sizes, aspect ratios, and border configurations
- **Print Resizing Calculator**: Calculate exposure adjustments and enlarger settings when changing print sizes
- **Stop-Based Exposure Calculator**: Calculate exposure adjustments by stops with precise timing
- **Camera Exposure Calculator**: Calculate equivalent camera exposure settings across aperture, shutter speed, and ISO
- **Reciprocity Calculator**: Calculate reciprocity failure compensation for various film stocks and long exposures
- **Development Recipes**: Comprehensive database of film development recipes with search, filtering, and custom recipe creation

### Additional Features

- **Settings**: App configuration and preferences
- **Cross-platform Support**: Native iOS, Android, and responsive web application
- **Preset Management**: Save, share, and manage calculation presets
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for mobile phones, tablets, and desktop browsers
- **Real-time Calculations**: Instant feedback with performance-optimized calculations using Web Workers
- **Dark/Light Theme**: Automatic theme switching based on system preferences

## Technology Stack

- **Framework**: React Native with Expo SDK 53
- **Language**: TypeScript with strict type checking
- **Package Manager**: Bun (preferred for faster builds and installs)
- **Runtime**: Node.js
- **Architecture**: Expo Router (File-based routing with typed routes)
- **Styling**: NativeWind (Tailwind CSS v4 for React Native) with Gluestack UI components
- **State Management**: React hooks with custom calculator hooks
- **Performance**: Web Workers for heavy calculations, React.memo optimizations
- **Testing**: Jest with React Native Testing Library
- **Code Quality**: ESLint, Prettier, Husky, lint-staged, commitlint
- **Deployment**: Vercel for web hosting with static site generation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
